## This is my report!

I like writing **reports**.


```{r example, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
# doing {r} makes the code executable, the word after is the name
# echo = false makes the code invisible
# include = false makes it so that no outputs are outputted
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)

hello <- "**hello world**"  # saving something to a variable and using inline r
                            # will get that thing and print it instead of printing the vector
                            # use markdown formatting to make it formatted

# use kable function to make tables nice, don't have time to make one


```

The mean of the numbers happens to be `r numbers_mean`.

Here is a message: `r hello`.


```{r other_chunk, include = FALSE}
source("exercise.r")
print(numbers)

```
`r kable(reviews)`
